* The data is a Clinical dataset. I am supposed to build a classifier model that predicts whether a patient has Hypothyroid or not.

* I am supposed to use various Support Vector Machine Kernel Functions and random forest to build models and select the best predictive model based on the metrics.

## Technologies Used

* I Used Google Colab as my primary work environment.
